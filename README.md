This is the Mobius Extruder.  It's a duel geared hobbed filament extruder designed for the Voron 2.  It is a 4:1 belt driven design to provide torque while being able to be near silent.  It has been tested to work with most flexibles in a Bowden configuration.  You must perform your own tuning to get the best results.
